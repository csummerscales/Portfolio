# Portfolio
Sampling of work I have done in different domains.

Classifiers.R - This is a script I worked on in my Data Mining course, basically designed to run classification algorithms (Naive Bayes and KNN) across the Seismic Bump dataset from UCI.

Foodle.cpp - Another one from my Data Mining course, a version of KNN I built from the ground up using a feature hashing technique along with bag of words.

Pandora.cpp - A dynamic programming solution for a problem my algorithms professor posted on Hacker Rank.  My solution won first place in the class.

Restaurant.cpp - Just a quick little Hacker Rank problem I did for fun (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/restaurant).

Sort.asm - From my assembly language class, I implemented quicksort in MIPS.  We didn't have to do quicksort, it was an option for extra credit.

Tracer.cxx - A ray tracing solution for spheres and cones.  From my Graphics algorithms class.
